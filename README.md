# Schaff Trend Cycle

Schaff Trend Cycle is a custom MT4/MT5/cTrader indicator coded by EarnForex.com. The indicator is adapted from the original TradeStation EasyLanguage version. Schaff Trend Cycle uses cycles to calculate a stochastic oscillator of a stochastic oscillator of a MACD main line.

The indicator supports all sorts of alerts, including arrows in the main window of the chart where the price trend cycle change is happening.
